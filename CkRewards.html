		<h3><strong>Step 1:</strong> Store Signup <i class="icon-qrcode"></i></h3>
		<p>After a quick signup process (or even creating the store account ourselves), stores would be given a special QR code that would uniquely identify their store for Commonkindness.  When this special QR code is scanned with our special app, Commonkindness can decode the information and combine that with the geolocation of the scan to prevent any possible store fraud when redeeming coupons.  </p>

		<h3><strong>Step 2:</strong> Customer Signup <i class="icon-user"></i></h3>
		<p>Existing customers of Commonkindness would be able to login to their iPhone/Andriod application to access their account.  Customers would be able to clip coupons directly on their phone or "Save for later" from their desktop computers, giving them the ultimate power to clip coupons whenever they have the time.</p>
		<p>Once the customer is ready to redeem, they have the option to print normally via the Commonkindness Time Saver printer app or just take their smartphone with them shopping.  All of the customers clippped coupons are available in a special, easy to read list that the customer can manage while shopping in a store.  They can easily add or remove coupons to their "Checkout now!" folder.<p>

		<h3><strong>Step 3:</strong> Customer checkout <i class="icon-barcode"></i></h3>
		<p>When finished shopping, customers can click their "Checkout Now" button that will present a single barcode that the cashier can scan.  Next, the cashier would present their store's QR code that would be scanned via the customers smartphone app.  This would combine the customer account, clipped coupons, store details, and geolocation of the scan ensuring a fraud free transaction.</p>
 
		<h3><strong>Step 4:</strong> Commonkindness Fulfillment <i class="icon-refresh"></i></h3>
		<p>Commonkindness would immediately deliver the information directly to the vendor about the redemption.  We would be able to market directly to both vendors, stores, and customers where previously impossible. </p>
