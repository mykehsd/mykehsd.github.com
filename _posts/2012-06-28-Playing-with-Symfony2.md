<p>There is no way better to learn a new framework then to start writing an application for it. I hear some chatter on a clients chatroom that it would be nice to have an internal pastebin type website. A place where they wouldn't have to worry about security and exposing sensitive data. I decided to code one up quickly in Symfony2 PR3, and thus Symbin was born. This literally took 3 hours from idea to git commit (with the design stolen from the default symfony2 css).
